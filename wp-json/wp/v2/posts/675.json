Instead of patching security flaws after products hit the market, the plan was to bake in protections from the start.<\/p>\n<p>This wasn\u2019t about strict regulations. Instead, it was part of the Biden administration\u2019s broader cyber strategy, encouraging vendors to voluntarily make security a baseline feature of their products.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward two years, and things look a lot more uncertain. Leadership changes, pushback from the industry, and a new political climate are all raising questions about whether Secure by Design will keep momentum or quietly fade into the background.<\/p>\n<h2>What Secure by Design Was All About<\/h2>\n<p>At its core, Secure by Design was about making security the default. Think multi-factor authentication (MFA) turned on by default, better logging without extra fees, and fewer exploitable bugs reaching users in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>The program\u2019s philosophy was clear: security should be part of the product DNA.<\/p>\n<h3>Wins So Far<\/h3>\n<p>For a voluntary program, Secure by Design scored some early victories.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over <strong>250 tech companies<\/strong> signed a seven-part pledge to improve software security.<\/li>\n<li>Big players like <strong>Microsoft and Google<\/strong> started showcasing their progress under the initiative.<\/li>\n<li>CISA published best-practice guidance and worked with international partners to give the effort global visibility.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These steps helped push the conversation toward one big takeaway: security needs to be designed in, not left for end users to figure out.<\/p>\n<h3>Where Industry Drew the Line<\/h3>\n<p>Not everyone was thrilled. Many tech execs felt the pledges were inching too close to regulation. They worried about higher costs, slower development, and government creep into their design decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Industry groups pushed back, arguing CISA was blurring the line between voluntary guidance and regulation. That resistance led to a<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cybersecuritydive.com\/news\/cisa-secure-by-design-initiative-limbo-key-leaders-resign\/745986\/\"> softer final pledge<\/a>, less binding than what CISA originally envisioned.<\/p>\n<p>Groups like BSA (The Software Alliance) even urged the White House to end what they called \u201cquasi-regulatory actions in cybersecurity.\u201d And while companies like<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/securityscorecard.com\/blog\/cisas-secure-by-design-a-year-later\/\"> SecurityScorecard<\/a> voiced support, they noted adoption was slow, only 199 signers in the first year, a small slice of the software industry.<\/p>\n<p>The message was clear: support was there, but only up to a point.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Leaders Step Away<\/h3>\n<p>The campaign also lost some of its biggest champions. In early 2025, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/pro\/security\/cisa-loses-two-more-cyber-pros-in-resignations\">Bob Lord and Lauren Zabierek<\/a>, two senior advisers who had been central to shaping the initiative, stepped down. Their exits followed the earlier departure of Jack Cable, another well-known contributor.<\/p>\n<p>Their work had made a real difference. Even skeptics admit Secure by Design helped raise standards. But without them inside CISA, keeping momentum won\u2019t be easy.<\/p>\n<h3>Politics Shifts the Ground<\/h3>\n<p>The return of the Trump administration adds another wrinkle. This White House is far less likely to back pressure campaigns on industry. Recent moves already signal a pullback, like<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cybersecuritydive.com\/news\/trump-cybersecurity-executive-order-eliminate-biden-programs\/750119\/?\"> rolling back Biden-era requirements for software vendors<\/a> to formally attest that they\u2019re using secure development practices. Now, only loose guidance remains.<\/p>\n<p>Industry voices are picking up on the shift. Henry Young of<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bsa.org\/news-events\/media\/bsa-anticipates-changes-to-cisa-rules-under-trump-administration?\"> BSA<\/a> predicted the campaign would \u201cevolve\u201d to balance government and business roles more realistically. Others are blunter: one CISA staffer told<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/cisa-cuts-trump-2\/?\"> Wired<\/a> that without strong White House support, Secure by Design becomes \u201ctoothless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In short, the political winds are blowing toward deregulation and business flexibility, not toward stricter software security obligations.<\/p>\n<h2>CISA\u2019s Stance Today<\/h2>\n<p>Despite the headwinds, CISA isn\u2019t abandoning ship. Acting Director Bridget Bean has doubled down on the message that companies need to build products that are secure out of the box, not pass the costs of weak design onto customers.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, she hinted that the program will \u201cevolve,\u201d which could mean scaling back, changing form, or simply becoming less visible.<\/p>\n<h2>What Could Happen Next<\/h2>\n<p>The road ahead for Secure by Design isn\u2019t set in stone. A few possibilities are on the table:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower profile<\/strong>: The pledge keeps going, but with less energy behind it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sunset<\/strong>: The program winds down formally, though the ideas live on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Industry-led<\/strong>: Leaders like Bob Lord continue the movement outside government.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each scenario raises the same big question: who should carry the responsibility for safer software, government, industry, or some mix of both?<\/p>\n<h2>Why It Matters<\/h2>\n<p>If Secure by Design loses steam, the risks fall back on consumers, small businesses, and the broader supply chain. Insecure products, rushed to market, could keep fueling breaches and attacks. And without strong standards, the gap between proactive companies and lagging ones will only widen.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the initiative has already left its mark. It set expectations that security needs to be designed in, not bolted on. Even if the official program changes or winds down, that cultural shift could continue to influence how products are built and sold.<\/p>\n<h2>At a Crossroads<\/h2>\n<p>Secure by Design was never just about one pledge or one agency. It\u2019s part of a bigger debate: who should own the responsibility for protecting users in a digital-first world?<\/p>\n<p>With leadership turnover, industry pushback, and a changing political climate, the program\u2019s future is cloudy. But the principles, security from the start, not after the fact, are here to stay.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CISA\u2019s Secure by Design faces an uncertain future as leadership exits, industry pushback, and political shifts raise questions about its role in software security.<\/p>\n","protected":false,"gt_translate_keys":[{"key":"rendered","format":"html"}]},"author":1,"featured_media":717,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-675","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-antivirus","wpbf-post"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v26.1.1 -
